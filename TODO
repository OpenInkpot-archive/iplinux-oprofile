0.0.7 task list
---------------

o I'm sick of these crappy makefiles. Let's see if we can use automake as well
  as autoconf.
 
o determine where we need ctx_sw_on/off to prevent pre-emption + test
 
o make/get rid of op_to_source to have similar interface to other utils

o Bob's rtc patch ?
 
0.0.8 task list
---------------
 
o implement proc->old_exec
 
o can we provide a small setuid helper for starting/stopping/flushing the profiler ?
 
Later
-----

o pentium 4 patches ?
 
o post-prof GUI ? (big job)

Correctness
-----------

o check chroot() processes and the path hash stuff
o There is no need for the daemon to run as root as long as every binary image
  is readable ...
o negative process entries in the daemon - a fork() into the pid would always succeed,
  in the meantime count the missed samples, possibly try to get info via /proc again ...
o why the overflow message at 12k ints/sec on do_dump() ? 

o maybe we should support a CPU mask for enabling counters (useful with
  processor pinning ?) 

Performance
-----------

o investigate eviction strategy
o the interrupt handler code could probably be improved by moving into asm
o can we fold in the "untouched sample entry" case in hash table to another case ?

WBNI
----

o we don't really need a vmlinux file during profiling ...
o Other x86 processors
