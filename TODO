Correctness
-----------

o Save counter state and restore on a finish
o check chroot() processes and the path hash stuff
o There is no need for the daemon to run as root as long as every binary image
  is readable ...
o negative process entries in the daemon - a fork() into the pid would always succeed,
  in the meantime count the missed samples, possibly try to get info via /proc again ...
o why the overflow message at 12k ints/sec on do_dump() ? 

Performance
-----------

o SMP algo can be totally re-worked to use a separate map device
o I think we can drop the thread if we are careful about locking/ints in the NMI handler
o investigate eviction strategy
o the interrupt handler code could probably be improved by moving into asm
o can we fold in the "untouched sample entry" case in hash table to another case ?
o change the path component hash to be pointer-parent pairs, and allocate the strings in
  a pool - prolly saving locality for the hash map
o daemon should not compose the path each time. use head component as lookup value

WBNI
----

o good support for determining changed profiles
o we don't really need a vmlinux file during profiling ...
o Other x86 processors
