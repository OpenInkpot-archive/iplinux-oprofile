0.0.8 task list
---------------
 
o determine where we need ctx_sw_on/off to prevent pre-emption + test
 
o can we provide a small setuid helper for starting/stopping/flushing the profiler ?
  is it a good idea ?
 
o move from racy sysctl to procfs, if it can be done nicely

o move .oprofile to name=value pairs to avoid conflicts on change.
 
Later
-----

o Bob's rtc patch ?
 
o pentium 4 patches ?
 
o post-prof GUI ? (big job)

o difference between two profile session. Difference must be made at source level. (This is a part of post-prof)

o integrate dasm, probably the best way is to allow to fall back to objdump.

o turn (or only compile) daemon in C++ to allow more code sharing with pp/gui
 is it a good idea ?

o use a filelock rather a sleep to synchronize op_start and daemon.

Correctness
-----------

o check chroot() processes and the path hash stuff
o negative process entries in the daemon - a fork() into the pid would always succeed,
  in the meantime count the missed samples, possibly try to get info via /proc again ...

o maybe we should support a CPU mask for enabling counters (useful with
  processor pinning ?) 

Performance
-----------

o investigate eviction strategy
o the interrupt handler code could probably be improved by moving into asm
o can we fold in the "untouched sample entry" case in hash table to another case ?

WBNI
----

o we don't really need a vmlinux file during profiling ...
o Other x86 processors
