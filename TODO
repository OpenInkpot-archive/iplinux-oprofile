0.0.6 task list
---------------

o Bob's rtc patch
 
o Save counter state and restore on a finish
 
o I'm sick of these crappy makefiles. Let's see if we can use automake as well
  as autoconf.
 
o remove oprofile thread. already exists in CVS branch BRANCH_NO_THREAD. This provides
  little performance advantage (even a pessimization on SMP) but removes code. 

o determine where we need ctx_sw_on/off to prevent pre-emption
 
o modify mapping to queue maps on a separate device. the daemon always
  apply all maps immediately before doing the samples

o incrementalise the daemon processing to smooth load and reduce mem usage
 
o make hashmap use string pool method
 
o fix zero component hash problem 
 
o make/get rid of op_to_source to have similar interface to other utils

o add --files=dae/,a.c,b.c option to annotated source for only certain files/dirs
 
0.0.7 task list
---------------
 
o implement proc->old_exec
 
o can we provide a small setuid helper for starting/stopping/flushing the profiler ?
 
Later
-----

o post-prof GUI ? (big job)

Correctness
-----------

o check chroot() processes and the path hash stuff
o There is no need for the daemon to run as root as long as every binary image
  is readable ...
o negative process entries in the daemon - a fork() into the pid would always succeed,
  in the meantime count the missed samples, possibly try to get info via /proc again ...
o why the overflow message at 12k ints/sec on do_dump() ? 

o maybe we should support a CPU mask for enabling counters (useful with
  processor pinning ?) 

Performance
-----------

o investigate eviction strategy
o the interrupt handler code could probably be improved by moving into asm
o can we fold in the "untouched sample entry" case in hash table to another case ?

WBNI
----

o we don't really need a vmlinux file during profiling ...
o Other x86 processors
