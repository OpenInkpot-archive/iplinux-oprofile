0.0.8 task list
---------------
 
o we need an overhaul of the docs. An overview of the tools section is needed.
  Discussion of problematic code needs to go in the "interpreting" section. Maybe
  you should add the nasm tricks somewhere Phil ?
 
o test test test
 
Later
-----

? o move .oprofile to name=value pairs to avoid conflicts on change.
 
o prepare for rtc:
	- move apic init to module init
	- export proc type sysctl
	- remove user-space proc type code
	- probe module on start to get proc type
	- generalise module start/stop/interrupt code (code move)

o determine where we need ctx_sw_on/off to prevent pre-emption + test
 
o move from racy sysctl to procfs, if it can be done nicely

o can we provide a small setuid helper for starting/stopping/flushing the profiler ?
  is it a good idea ?
 
o Bob's rtc patch ?
 
o can we add some code for linux kernel spinlock contention in .text.lock ?

o pentium 4 patches ?
 
o post-prof GUI ? (big job)

o difference between two profile session. Difference must be made at source level. 
  (This is a part of post-prof)

o integrate dasm, probably the best way is to allow to fall back to objdump.

o turn (or only compile) daemon in C++ to allow more code sharing with pp/gui
  is it a good idea ?

o use a filelock rather a sleep to synchronize op_start and daemon.

Correctness
-----------

o check chroot() processes and the path hash stuff
o negative process entries in the daemon - a fork() into the pid would always succeed,
  in the meantime count the missed samples, possibly try to get info via /proc again ...

o maybe we should support a CPU mask for enabling counters (useful with
  processor pinning ?) 

Performance
-----------

o the interrupt handler code could probably be improved by moving into asm
o can we fold in the "untouched sample entry" case in hash table to another case ?

WBNI
----

o we don't really need a vmlinux file during profiling ...
o Other x86 processors
