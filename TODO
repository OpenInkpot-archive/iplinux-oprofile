Correctness
-----------
 
o The module must not be unloadable.
o SMP mappings - place in all buffers perhaps ? 
o check chroot() processes and do_d_path() 
 
Performance
----------- 
 
o The note spinlock and stop/start should be grouped into one for multiple map adding.
o investigate eviction strategy
o the interrupt handler code could probably be improved by moving into asm, and using arch=ppro 
o can we fold in the "untouched sample entry" case in hash table to another case ? 
o would query_module() be faster ? do we care ? 

WBNI
----

o Other x86 processors, and maybe other archs.
o gprof output from post-profiler
