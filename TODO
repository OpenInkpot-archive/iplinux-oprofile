0.0.8 task list
---------------
 
o I'm sick of these crappy makefiles. Let's see if we can use automake as well
  as autoconf. At least for user-space stuff.
 
o determine where we need ctx_sw_on/off to prevent pre-emption + test
 
o implement proc->old_exec
 
o can we provide a small setuid helper for starting/stopping/flushing the profiler ?
  is it a good idea ?
 
o move from racy sysctl to procfs, if it can be done nicely

o code factorisation between opf_filter / gui, more opf_filter/opf_container cleanup

o ac kernel series allow to configure for 32 bits pid, we must check against that
 
o move .oprofile to name=value pairs to avoid conflicts on change.
 
Later
-----

o Bob's rtc patch ?
 
o pentium 4 patches ?
 
o post-prof GUI ? (big job)

o difference between two profile session. Difference must be made at source level. How to save the old binary files if needed ? (This is a part of post-prof)

o integrate dasm, probably the best way is to allow to fall back to objdump.

Correctness
-----------

o check chroot() processes and the path hash stuff
o negative process entries in the daemon - a fork() into the pid would always succeed,
  in the meantime count the missed samples, possibly try to get info via /proc again ...

o maybe we should support a CPU mask for enabling counters (useful with
  processor pinning ?) 

Performance
-----------

o investigate eviction strategy
o the interrupt handler code could probably be improved by moving into asm
o can we fold in the "untouched sample entry" case in hash table to another case ?

WBNI
----

o we don't really need a vmlinux file during profiling ...
o Other x86 processors
