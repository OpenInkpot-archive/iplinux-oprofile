0.0.5 task list
---------------

o get opf_filter and friends working OK
 
o fix showing all counters for oprofpp -s
 
o clean up starting GUI

o check documentation

o re-do performance tests
 
0.0.6 task list
---------------

o remove oprofile thread. instead we check against irq counts and
  global_irq_lock and only precede if we can lock against other CPUs
  and we are not interrupting an interrupt

o modify mapping to queue maps on a separate device. the daemon always
  applys all maps immediately before doing the samples

o incrementalise the daemon processing to smooth load
 
o make hashmap use string pool method
 
o implement proc->old_exec 
 
o post-prof GUI ? (big job)
 
Correctness
-----------

o Save counter state and restore on a finish
o check chroot() processes and the path hash stuff
o There is no need for the daemon to run as root as long as every binary image
  is readable ...
o negative process entries in the daemon - a fork() into the pid would always succeed,
  in the meantime count the missed samples, possibly try to get info via /proc again ...
o why the overflow message at 12k ints/sec on do_dump() ? 

o maybe we should support a CPU mask for enabling counters (useful with
  processor pinning ?) 

Performance
-----------

o investigate eviction strategy
o the interrupt handler code could probably be improved by moving into asm
o can we fold in the "untouched sample entry" case in hash table to another case ?

WBNI
----

o we don't really need a vmlinux file during profiling ...
o Other x86 processors
