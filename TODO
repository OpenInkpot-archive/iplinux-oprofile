Correctness
-----------

o Save counter state and restore on a finish
o Athlon: bit 22 is per-counter, determine working event types, support 4 counters, documentation
o SMP mappings - place in all buffers perhaps ?
o check chroot() processes and the path hash stuff
o There is no need for the daemon to run as root as long as every binary image
  is readable ...
o negative process entries in the daemon - a fork() into the pid would always succeed,
  in the meantime count the missed samples, possibly try to get info via /proc again ...
o why the overflow message at 12k ints/sec on do_dump() ? 

Performance
-----------

o The note spinlock and stop/start should be grouped into one for multiple map adding.
o investigate eviction strategy
o the interrupt handler code could probably be improved by moving into asm
o can we fold in the "untouched sample entry" case in hash table to another case ?
o change the path component hash to be pointer-parent pairs, and allocate the strings in
  a pool - prolly saving locality for the hash map

WBNI
----

o good support for determining changed profiles
o compile-time interrupt accounting (sysctl-read/writeable) - then re-do results/rates/
o we don't really need a vmlinux file during profiling ...
o Other x86 processors
