This is a beta release version of oprofile, a transparent
low-overhead system-wide profiler.

You can find some documentation in the doc/oprofile/ directory.

Please visit the oprofile website at : http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/ 

oprofile was written by John Levon <moz@compsoc.man.ac.uk>.

Philippe Elie <ph_e@club-internet.fr> contributed a fix for unit-mask
testing, verified many of the event types experimentally, wrote
the tcl/tk oprofile interface, added options to oprofpp, and made various
other small fixes.
