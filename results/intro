This directory contains some results of tests conducted examining various
aspects of the profiler. Hopefully it can be fleshed out a little more soon.

Everything was conducted on my home test machine, a UP Celeron Coppermine 600MHz,
128Mb RAM, UDMA 66 hda, with a VIA VT82C693/A based Gigabyte 693A-596B-8671 motherboard.

Unless otherwise specified, the kernel tested under was 2.4.0ac9
